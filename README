The FITS Interferometry Data Interchange Convention (“FITS-IDI”) is a set of conventions layered upon the standard FITS format to assist in the interchange of data recorded by interferometric telescopes, particularly at radio frequencies and very long baselines.

These scripts create FITS IDI files out of data. They are designed for CASPER instruments such as the ROACH correlator.
